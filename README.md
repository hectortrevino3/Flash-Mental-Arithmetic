<h1>About The Project</h1>
This is a simple but effective math game designed to help improve mental arithmetic skills. The game flashes a series of numbers on the screen in quick succession, then challenges the user to calculate and enter the sum. It was a fun personal project and a great introduction to building applications with a graphical user interface (GUI).

<h1>Key Features</h1>

- Responsive User Interface: The game's UI is dynamic, automatically scaling all visual elements based on the size of the window.

- Asynchronous Game Loop: To manage the fast-paced timing of the number flashes without freezing the application, the game uses an asynchronous game loop (async/await), ensuring it runs smoothly and remains responsive.

- Progressive Difficulty System: The game features a progressive difficulty system that adjusts the quantity and value of the numbers presented based on the user's performance across 10 distinct levels.

<h1>Built With</h1>

- C#

- .NET Framework (Windows Forms)
